This project implements a Random Forest model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. 
By analyzing patterns in transaction data, the model identifies anomalies and flags suspicious activities. Key aspects of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling class imbalance, scaling, and cleaning the data for optimal model performance.
Random Forest Model: Building a robust ensemble model for classification, leveraging its ability to handle non-linear data and reduce overfitting.
Model Evaluation: Assessing performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Optimization: Tuning hyperparameters such as the number of trees and maximum depth to enhance fraud detection accuracy.
This project demonstrates how Random Forests can be applied to detect credit card fraud effectively.
